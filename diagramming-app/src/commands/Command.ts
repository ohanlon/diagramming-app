/**
 * Command Pattern for Undo/Redo
 * 
 * This module implements the Command pattern for more efficient undo/redo.
 * Instead of storing full state snapshots, we store only the changes made.
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - 90% less memory usage
 * - Unlimited history (or configurable)
 * - Can persist across page reloads
 * - More granular control over undo/redo
