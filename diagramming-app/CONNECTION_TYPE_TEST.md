# Connection Type Update Functionality Test

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The following functionality has been successfully implemented:

### **What was added:**

1. **Dynamic Connection Type Updates**: When users change the connection type from the toolbar dropdown:
   - **Selected Connectors**: All selected connectors immediately change to the new connection type
   - **Future Connectors**: All newly drawn connectors use the selected connection type
   - **Live Preview**: The drawing preview shows the selected connection type while drawing

2. **History Support**: Connection type changes are recorded in history for undo/redo functionality

3. **Consistent Behavior**: Follows the same pattern as other connector style changes (line style, line width, arrows)

### **How it works:**

1. **User selects connector(s)** on the canvas
2. **User changes Connection Type** from dropdown (Direct → Orthogonal → Bezier)
3. **Selected connectors immediately redraw** with the new connection algorithm
4. **Future connections** use the newly selected type
5. **Changes are undoable** via Ctrl+Z

### **Testing Steps:**

1. Draw some connections using "Direct" style
2. Select one or more connectors  
3. Change connection type to "Orthogonal" - selected connectors should redraw with 90° angles
4. Change to "Bezier" - selected connectors should redraw as smooth curves
5. Draw new connectors - they should use the currently selected style
6. Use Ctrl+Z to undo changes

### **Code Changes Made:**

- **`useDiagramStore.ts`**: Updated `setSelectedConnectionType` to:
  - Add history recording with `addHistory(set, get)`
  - Update `connectionType` property of selected connectors
  - Follow same pattern as `setSelectedLineStyle` and other connector actions

- **Connector Component**: Already properly uses `connector.connectionType` for rendering
- **Canvas Component**: Already uses `activeSheet.selectedConnectionType` for preview

### **Behavior:**
- **With connectors selected**: Only selected connectors change type
- **With no connectors selected**: New connectors will use the selected type  
- **Mixed selection**: Users can have different connection types on different connectors
- **Undo/Redo**: Full support for undoing connection type changes

## ✨ Ready to Use!

The connection type update functionality is now complete and ready for testing in the application.
